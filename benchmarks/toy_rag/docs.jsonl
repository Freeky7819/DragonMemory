{"doc_id": "nn_1", "title": "Neural Networks Basics", "text": "A neural network is a machine learning model inspired by the brain. It consists of layers of artificial neurons. Each neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs, applies a non-linear activation function and passes the result forward. During training the network adjusts its weights to minimize a loss function on the data."}

Black holes are characterized by mass, spin and charge. The boundary beyond which nothing can return is called the event horizon. Around many black holes, an accretion disk of hot gas emits X-rays."}
{"doc_id": "rag_1", "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation", "text": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique where a language model is combined with a search component. At query time the system retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base, then feeds them to the model as additional context. This allows the model to answer questions with up-to-date or domain-specific information without retraining the model itself."}
